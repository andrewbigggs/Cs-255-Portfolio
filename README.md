# Cs-255-Portfolio

In this course, I worked with a fictional client company named DriverPass to help them design a system that enables students
to pass the DMV Driver's License exam by providing tools for study and practice, all accessible over the Internet.
I believe I did a great job at understanding and outlining exactly what the requirements and limitations for the system are.

I believe the system that designates the hierarchy of company users for the DriverPass application can be improved by specifying
exactly each role's duties and authorizations.

In this project, I knew each user would have to access their account through either a mobile operating system or Internet browser.
From this interface, each user will have access to their proficiency in Driver's Education courses, practice exams, and practice
drives. It's important to make sure the users will be able to have all their needs met easily and efficiently when using the
system, since user satisfaction is the ultimate metric by which the system's success is measured.

Understanding the application from an abstract high-level view down to an object/entity-oriented view to a functional, 
low-level view is important to making syntactical and semantic decisions when developing the software. Although analyzing and
designing the system takes a lot of time and is an iterative process, it lays out a solid foundation for how development will
proceed, enabling coders and testers to spend their time choosing, designing, and building the most efficient data structures and
algorithms.
